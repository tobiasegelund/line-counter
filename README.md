# Line counter

Just a funny random project. Instead of using the command wc -l to count lines of a file. This program does exactly the same but using the command lc. I know this could also just have been done by an alias...

## Downlaod
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobiasegelund/line-counter.git
```
or
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tobiasegelund/line-counter.git
```

## Usage
```bash
lc <FILENAME>
```

## Installation
```bash
make build
```
